#### Description
This comprehensive mind map illustrates Gemini's responsible deployment framework. It is structured around key pillars: Impact Assessment (at both model and product levels), Safety Policies (defining guidelines and priorities), Mitigations (data curation and model-level techniques), and Safety Evaluations (encompassing development, assurance, external, and red teaming approaches). This diagram emphasizes the multi-layered strategy for identifying, measuring, and managing potential societal impacts of Gemini models.
