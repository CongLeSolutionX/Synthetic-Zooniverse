### Explanation of the Diagram

This Mermaid diagram presents a structured overview of the experimental results from the FlashAttention paper.  It uses subgraphs to categorize related findings and uses different colors to visually distinguish the main areas of experimental evaluation. The diagram focuses on conveying the key quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting the speed and memory efficiency gains achieved by FlashAttention and its block-sparse variant.

### Improvements over the previous response

* **Focus on Quantitative Results:** The diagram now explicitly emphasizes the quantitative aspects of the experimental results (e.g., speedups, perplexity improvements) using phrases like "15% faster," "up to 3x faster."  This provides a clearer picture of the magnitude of the improvements.
* **Specific Figure References:** The addition of "Figure 3" and other figure references makes it directly clear what figures in the original text this diagram corresponds to.
* **Relationship between subgraphs:** The diagram now better connects the subgraph describing the experiments to the runtime/memory plots and the subgraph describing the impact of hardware configurations.
* **Visual Distinction:**  Colors are used consistently to visually differentiate different parts of the experiment, such as training speed, model quality, and attention benchmarking.

This improved diagram provides a more concise and visually appealing way to understand the experimental results of the FlashAttention paper.  Remember to adapt the specific details (e.g., quantitative values) to match the actual tables and figures in the original paper. Remember to include tables and figures corresponding to the results sections.
