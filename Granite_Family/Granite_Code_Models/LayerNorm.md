## LayerNorm - A Diagrammatic Guide 


The diagram below provides a succinct visual explanation of the LayerNorm process within the Granite Code Model architecture.


**Concept:** Layer Normalization within the Granite Code Model architecture

**Nodes:**

*   `LayerNorm`: Main node, representing the Layer Normalization technique.
*   `Input`: Input to the LayerNorm layer (Activations from the previous layer).
*   `Output`: Output of the LayerNorm layer (Normalized activations).
*   `Mean Calculation`: The calculation of the mean across the features.
*   `Variance Calculation`: The calculation of the variance across the features.
*   `Normalization Step`: The step where the input is normalized using the calculated mean and variance.
*   `Scale (γ)`: Learnable scale parameter.
*   `Bias (β)`: Learnable bias parameter.

**Edges:**

*   Edges show the flow of data and operations within the LayerNorm process.

**Mermaid Code Example:**

### Explanation of the diagram and the choices made

*   **Focus:**  The diagram concentrates only on the LayerNorm operation, omitting broader architectural details for clarity.
*   **Data Flow:** The directed edges show how data progresses through the LayerNorm process.
*   **Key Steps:** The core calculations (mean, variance, normalization) are highlighted as separate nodes.
*   **Learnable Parameters:**  The scale (γ) and bias (β) parameters are included, as they are key components of LayerNorm.
*   **Formula Annotations:** Key equations are included as edge annotations to provide a succinct mathematical description.
*   **Style:** A distinct fill color highlights the core concept "LayerNorm".

### Key Takeaways

*   The diagram represents the process of normalization, highlighting the importance of mean and variance calculation in LayerNorm.
*   The annotations provide context for the different steps and their formulas, making it easier to grasp the mathematical aspect.
*   The diagram can be expanded to include other normalization techniques (RMSNorm), providing a comparative visualization.
