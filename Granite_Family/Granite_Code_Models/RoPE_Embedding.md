## RoPE Embedding - A Diagrammatic Guide 


Based on the original document, here's the Mermaid diagram representing RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) as it relates to the Granite Code Models:

### Explanation

*   **A [Position Embeddings]:** This is the general concept that RoPE falls under. The need for position embeddings comes from the Transformer architecture being inherently order-agnostic.
*   **B {RoPE Embedding}:** This is the main concept of the diagram.
*   **C [Granite-3B-Code]:** Connects the specific model (Granite-3B-Code) to the technique (RoPE), as RoPE is used in this architecture
*   **D [Relative Position Encoding]:** RoPE is a type of relative position encoding. Relative position encodings help the model understand the distances between tokens.
*   **E [Rotary Transformations]:** Key idea behind RoPE is to encode position information using rotation matrices.
*   **F [Frequency Domain]:** Connects the rotary transformations with the frequency domain, as the rotations are performed in this domain.
