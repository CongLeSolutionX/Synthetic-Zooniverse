### Explanation

*   **Purpose (B):** The Gram-Schmidt process aims to transform a given basis into an orthonormal basis.  This is useful in various applications, particularly in linear algebra and machine learning where orthonormal bases simplify calculations.

*   **Two-Vector Case (Subgraph):**  Illustrates the core concept of the process for two vectors (`a1` and `a2`).  It shows how to normalize the first vector (`a1`) to `q1`, project the second vector (`a2`) onto `q1`, and then subtract the projection from `a2` to get a vector orthogonal to `q1`, which is then normalized to `q2`.

*   **General Case (Subgraph):** Shows the iterative process that extends the two-vector case to any number of vectors (`a1`, `a2`, ..., `a<sub>n</sub>`).  The algorithm iteratively calculates vectors (`q<sub>1</sub>`, `q<sub>2</sub>`, ..., `q<sub>n</sub>`) that are orthogonal to each other and have a unit norm.


*   **Result (Subgraph):**  Summarizes the outcome of the process: an orthonormal basis (`Q`) and an upper triangular matrix (`R`). The elements of matrix `R` are derived from the dot products between the original basis vectors (`a<sub>i</sub>`) and the orthonormal vectors (`q<sub>j</sub>`).  The process results in a matrix `Q` with orthonormal column vectors that span the same space as the original basis vectors.


**Key Concepts and Notation:**

*   **a<sub>i</sub>:** The original basis vectors.
*   **q<sub>i</sub>:** The orthonormal basis vectors generated by the process.
*   **proj<sub>q1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>:** The projection of `a<sub>2</sub>` onto `q<sub>1</sub>`.
*   **||v||<sub>2</sub>:** The Euclidean norm (length) of vector `v`.
*   **q<sub>j</sub><sup>T</sup>a<sub>i</sub>:** The dot product of vector `q<sub>j</sub>` and `a<sub>i</sub>`.

This diagram effectively conveys the Gram-Schmidt process's steps and outcomes, focusing on both the intuitive two-vector case and the generalized algorithm for any number of vectors.  The inclusion of the matrix `R` helps in understanding its role in the QR decomposition, a critical application of the Gram-Schmidt process.
