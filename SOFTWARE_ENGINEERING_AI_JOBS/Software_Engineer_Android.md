**Explanation:**

*   **Purpose:**  This graph visually connects each responsibility to the qualifications needed to fulfill it.  This helps a candidate understand *why* each qualification is required.
*   **Nodes:**  Responsibilities and Qualifications are grouped into separate subgraphs.
*   **Edges:**  Arrows ("Requires") indicate which qualifications are necessary for each responsibility.  For example, "Research, Design, Develop, Test" requires a CS degree, 5 years of general experience, and 2 years of experience in various specific areas.

---

### **2. Actionable Advice for Candidates**

This section provides concrete steps a candidate can take to gain and demonstrate the required qualifications.

#### **2.1 Education:**

*   **Action:** Obtain a Bachelor's degree in a relevant field (Computer Science, Computer Engineering, etc.).  If you're already past this stage, consider relevant certifications or online courses to fill knowledge gaps.

#### **2.2 General Experience (5 Years):**

*   **Action:**  Seek out roles that provide broad exposure to software development.  Focus on projects that involve the full software development lifecycle (SDLC).  This could include internships, entry-level positions, or even contributing to open-source projects.

#### **2.3 Specific Experience (2 Years):**

*   **2.3.1 C, C++, C#, or Java:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   **Practice:**  Work on projects that require these languages. Start with small projects and gradually increase complexity.  LeetCode, HackerRank, and similar platforms are excellent for practice.
        *   **Demonstrate:**  Build a portfolio of projects on GitHub that showcase your proficiency.  Contribute to open-source projects that use these languages.
        *   **Open Source Examples:**
            *   **C++:**  [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) (Operating System), [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) (Game Engine)
            *   **Java:**  [Apache Hadoop](https://github.com/apache/hadoop) (Distributed Processing), [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) (Search Engine)
            *   **C#:** [.NET Runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) (Runtime Environment)

*   **2.3.2 Python, PHP, or Haskell:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   **Practice:**  Similar to the above, practice with projects and online resources.
        *   **Demonstrate:**  Build a portfolio, contribute to open source.
        *   **Open Source Examples:**
            *   **Python:**  [Django](https://github.com/django/django) (Web Framework), [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) (Web Framework)
            *   **PHP:**  [WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress) (Content Management System), [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) (Web Framework)
            *   **Haskell:** [xmonad](https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad) (Window Manager), [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) (Document Converter)

*   **2.3.3 Software Development Tools:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   **Practice:**  Become proficient with VIM or Emacs.  Use Git for version control on *all* your projects, even small ones.
        *   **Demonstrate:**  Your GitHub profile will demonstrate your Git usage.  Configuring your VIM/Emacs setup and sharing it (e.g., as a dotfiles repository) can also be a demonstration.
        *   **Open Source Examples:**  Almost any open-source project will use a revision control system. Look for projects that seem interesting to you and contribute.

*   **2.3.4 Core Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**
    *   **Action:**
        *   **Practice:**  Build websites and web applications.  Start with simple static sites and move on to dynamic applications.
        *   **Demonstrate:**  A portfolio of web projects is essential.  Contribute to open-source web projects.
        *   **Open Source Examples:**  [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) (JavaScript Library), [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) (JavaScript Framework)

*   **2.3.5 Highly-Scalable Performant Solutions:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   **Learn:**  Study system design principles.  Read about load balancing, caching, databases, and other concepts related to scalability.
        *   **Practice:**  Design and implement (even on a small scale) systems that *could* scale.  Think about how you would handle increasing traffic or data volume.
        *   **Demonstrate:**  Document your design decisions and explain how your projects address scalability concerns.  This can be done in a blog post or in the README of your project.

*   **2.3.6 Broad CS Knowledge:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   **Learn:**  Take courses (online or in person) on the listed topics. Solid understanding on data structure and algorithm is essential for any roles.
        *   **Practice:**  Apply these concepts in your projects.  For example, use networking concepts when building a client-server application.
        *   **Demonstrate:**  This is harder to demonstrate directly, but it will become evident in your code quality, design decisions, and problem-solving skills.

*   **2.3.7 Algorithm Application:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   **Practice:**  Work on algorithmic problems (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.).  Focus on understanding the underlying patterns and how different algorithms can be applied to different problems.
        *   **Demonstrate:**  Explain your thought process when solving algorithmic problems in interviews.  Show how you can identify and apply relevant patterns.  Document your approach in your code (comments and README).
