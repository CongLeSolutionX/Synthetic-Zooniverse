### Explanation of the Diagram Structure and Adaptation

*   **Root Node:** The central concept is "Gemini Multimodal Models."
*   **Key Sections as Subgraphs:** The main aspects of the Gemini models are structured as subgraphs (e.g., "Architecture," "Training," "Post-Training," "Evaluation").
*   **Details Within Subgraphs:** Each subgraph is then further broken down into more specific nodes, providing details about that aspect of the model.
*   **Key Attributes as Leaf Nodes:** Attributes are represented by leaf nodes at the ends of the branches, such as "Efficient attention mechanisms" under "Architecture" or "Web documents, books, code" under "Training Data."
*   **Equations and Metrics:** The equations or specific benchmark metrics are included in the nodes where they're most relevant (e.g., the MMLU score under "Evaluation" -> "Text").
*   **Annotations:** Annotations are used to provide extra context or notes on specific components of the model. These are included in the node details (":::detail").
