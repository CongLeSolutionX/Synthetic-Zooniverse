### Explanation

This Mermaid graph visually represents one-shot in-context learning.  It's a simplified version of the broader in-context learning concept, focusing specifically on the case where a single demonstration is used to guide the model.

* **Subgraph `One-Shot In-Context Learning`:** Encloses the core elements.
* **Node `A` (In-Context Learning):** Represents the overall concept.
* **Node `B` (One-Shot Learning):** The specific focus of the diagram.
* **Node `C` (Key Idea):**  Highlights the fundamental ideaâ€”learning from a single example.
* **Subgraph `OneShotExample` (Example):**  Illustrates the concept with a concrete text-classification scenario.
    *   **Node `D` (Example):** Shows the task.
    *   **Nodes `D1` to `D7`:** Detail the instruction, demonstrations, and the resulting output for a new input.
* **Node `E` (Prompt Structure):** Shows the structure of the prompt containing the instruction and the example.
