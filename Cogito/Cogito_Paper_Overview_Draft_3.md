**Explanation:**

*   **Agent Team:**  Lists the three core roles (Planner, Coder, Debugger) and the Super-Role as part of the Cogito agent team.
*   **Learning Cycles (Group 1, 2, 3):**  Represents the three stages of the reverse learning sequence as separate groups. Each group focuses on a specific role: Debugger, Coder, and Planner respectively.
*   **Role Interaction:** Arrows between Planner, Coder, and Debugger indicate the collaborative workflow within a traditional sequence (even though Cogito uses reverse order for learning, these roles still interact conceptually).
*   **Super-Role Rotation:**  The "SuperRole -- Rotation through Roles --> Agent Team" arrow signifies the Super-Role's dynamic participation across all roles during the learning process.
*   **Memory Accumulation:**  "SuperRole -- Memory Accumulation --> SuperRole" highlights that the Super-Role retains and builds upon experiences from each role.
*   **Super-Role Expertise & Final Solution:** Shows the Super-Role's transition to an expert capable of independent problem-solving and delivering the final code solution.
*   **Experience Feedback:** Arrows from `G*_Output` to `SuperRole` depict how the outputs of each learning stage (Debugger, Coder, Planner experiences) feed into the Super-Role's knowledge base.
