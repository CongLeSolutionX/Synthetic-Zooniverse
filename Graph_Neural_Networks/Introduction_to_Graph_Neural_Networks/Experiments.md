### Explanation and Diagram Improvements

* **Detailed Breakdown of Experiments:** The diagram now explicitly shows the different aspects of the experimental setup and analysis:  hyperparameter tuning, training conditions, model comparison, and qualitative analysis.
* **Relationships between Concepts:** Arrows clearly connect each experimental aspect (e.g., "Hidden Dimensions" to "Improved Performance on High Homophily").
* **Specific Outcomes:** The diagram now includes more specific outcomes and observations from the experiments. For example, B111 points to "Improved Performance on High Homophily" as a direct outcome of tuning hidden dimensions. This makes the diagram more descriptive and insightful.
* **Qualitative Analysis:** The diagram explicitly shows the qualitative analysis component, including the analysis of signal and noise energies.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning Details:**  The subgraph for hyperparameter tuning now shows the specific hyperparameters tuned and the types of analyses performed (e.g., "Training Epochs" and "Convergence and Stability on High Homophily").
* **Visual Structure:**  The diagram remains clear and well-organized, using different shapes and colors (using `style`) to distinguish between the different components of the experiments.
