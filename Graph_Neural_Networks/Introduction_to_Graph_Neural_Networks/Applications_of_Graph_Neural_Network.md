### Explanation

* **Hierarchical Structure:** The diagram groups applications into meaningful categories (Node Classification, Link Prediction, etc.) using subgraphs, mirroring the previous diagram structure.
* **Clarity and Conciseness:**  Each application is represented by a concise label.
* **Detailed Descriptions (Implicit):** The relationships within each subgraph imply the various aspects of each application, as described in the original text. For example, "Social networks (roles, interests, group membership)" under "Node Classification" shows various applications of node classification in social contexts.
* **Contextual Connections:**  The arrows connecting the applications to the main "Applications" box emphasize the relationship to GNNs as the method for performing these tasks.


This improved diagram provides a more visually clear and organized representation of the diverse applications of GNNs, as described in the original text.  Remember that these are just the *categories*, and further detail can be added by annotating the nodes with specific examples or relevant equations. For example, the `Node Classification` category could include more specific sub-nodes for particular domains like social network analysis, bioinformatics, etc.
